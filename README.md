# Konekaappari
Konekaappari is a website based on the open API of Open Sky Networks. The locations of the aircrafts are fetched from All State Vectors API and the rest of the information from Flights by Aircraft API. Then the aircrafts are drawn on a map using OpenStreetMap and leaflet.js.

This project has been made as an group assignment. More information from the tekijat.html. The website and Commentation is in Finnish as it was originally requested.
